	<center><h2>Bali</h2></center>
	<p>Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago. It’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality as well as exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of exotic, local cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors.

    Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles offer plenty to see and do, but you won't want to stay away from the coastline for long. Popular beach resorts include Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many of the finest hotels and villas look over world-class surf spots. For tranquil seascapes and sunrises, Sanur, Nusa Dua and remote Candidasa are your best bets. Bali’s lesser travelled eastern and northern regions also offer wonderful diving spots in calm bays, with coral gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.</p>
    <p>What to do in Bali: When it comes to things to do in Bali, your holiday can be filled with culture, nature, art, and the spiritual. The spectacular beaches of Kuta, Nusa Dua and Seminyak offer hours of swimming, surfing and sunbathing, while the cultural area of Ubud is known for its picturesque rice terraces. Get away from the crowds by visiting the northern and eastern coasts, where hidden waterfalls wait to be discovered.

    Bali's west coast has tapering ranges of mountains covered in lush forests, rice fields, and bountiful vegetation. The island also has hundreds of historical sites that have stood the tests of time. From royal palaces to holy temples, you get to see a different glimpse of Bali at these exotic spots.</p>

Singapore is also known as "Instant Asia" because it offers visitors a quick glimpse of the Asian cultures that immigrants have brought from all parts of the continent.</p>
